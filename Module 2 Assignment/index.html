       <h1> Best Baseball Teams </h1>
       <div id= "Giants"><h3> San Francisco Giants</h3>
       <p> The San Francisco Giants had the best record of any team this season. They won 107 games in the regular season. Their year ended in disappointment. 
       They lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the first round of the playoffs. </p>
       
       <div id= "Dodgers"><h3> Los Angeles Dodgers</h3>
       <p> The Dodgers had an excellent year. They entered the year as defending World Series Champions. They had the second best record in the league, finishing
       with 106 wins. They lost in the second round of the playoffs to the Atlanta Braves. </p>
       
       <div id= "Braves"><h3> Atlanta Braves</h3>
       <p> The Atlanta Braves did not play great in the regular season. In fact, they only made the playoffs because they played in a bad division. 
       They had the worst record of any team in the playoffs. But they played well in October, and defeated Houston in the World Series. </p>
